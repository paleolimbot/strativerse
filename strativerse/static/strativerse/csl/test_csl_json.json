Short cores were taken from two remote sites located close to the sea. Significant lead enrichments in the upper layers at both sites reflect the increasing emission of lead into the atmosphere due to anthropogenic activities during the last century. At the Scottish site, a region under aeolian influence from Europe, anthropogenic derived lead could be recognized by the distinctive unradiogenic composition (206Pby207Pb ratios down to ;1.115), being clearly different from the pre-industrial values (206Pby207Pb ;1.166). In contrast, the lead pollution in eastern Canada (influenced by North American sources) is identified by a more radiogenic lead isotope composition (206Pby207Pb ratios up to ;1.199) compared to pre- industrial values (206Pby207Pb ;1.161). Emission inventories and isotope characteristics suggest that industrial (coal burning, mining) and traffic (leaded gasoline) outputs are the most likely sources during the first and the second half of the 20th century, respectively, in both, western Scotland and eastern Canada alike. The Scottish record is in line with previous studies of past atmospheric lead deposition. However, the Canadian deposit suggests that the wind derived, pre-industrial lead, is less radiogenic as previously implied using sediment archives. These results are thus the first to report pre-industrial lead isotope ratios and concentrations of atmospheric derived aerosols in North America.","DOI":"10.1016/S0048-9697(02)00025-6","author":[{"family":"Weiss","given":"D"},{"family":"Shotyk","given":"William"},{"family":"Boyle","given":"Edward A"},{"family":"Kramers","given":"J.

Annual sedimentation throughout the cores (glacial varves) is identified on photographs, ITRAX (high-resolution continuous microfluorescence-X) and CAT-Scan (computerized axial tomography) analyses and is supported by (1) the number of dark and light laminations between dates obtained by radionuclide measurements (137Cs, 241Am), (2) the correlation of a slump triggered by the nearby AD 1881 Allemond earthquake (MSK intensity VII) and of a turbidite triggered by the AD 1822 Chautagne regional earthquake (MSK intensity VIII), (3) the number of laminations between two accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) 14C dates, and (4) archaeological data. In Lake Bramant, dark layers are coarser, contain less detrital elements, but more neoformed elements and organic matter content. These darker laminations result from calm background sedimentation, whereas the lighter layers are finer and rich in detrital elements and reflect the summer snowmelt. Traces of mining activity during the Roman civilization apogee (AD 115–330) and during the Early Bronze Age (3770–3870 cal BP) are recorded by lead and copper content in the sediments and probably result from regional and local mining activity in the NW Alps. Warmer climate during the Bronze Age in this part of the Alps is suggested by (1) two organic deposits (4160–3600 cal BP and 3300–2850 cal BP) likely reflecting a lower lake level and smaller glaciers and (2) evidence of a different vegetation cover around 2500 m a.s.l. The onset of clastic proglacial sedimentation between 3600–3300 cal BP and since 2850 cal BP is synchronous with periods of glacier advances documented in the Alps and high-lake levels in west-central Europe. This major change in proglacial sedimentation highlights the development of a larger St. Sorlin glacier in the catchment area of Lake Bramant.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379107001928","DOI":"10.1016/j.quascirev.2007.07.007","ISSN":"0277-3791","author":[{"family":"Guyard","given":"Hervé"},{"family":"Chapron","given":"Emmanuel"},{"family":"St-Onge","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Anselmetti","given":"Flavio S."},{"family":"Arnaud","given":"Fabien"},{"family":"Magand","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Francus","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Mélières","given":"Marie-Antoinette"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,10]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,10,2]]},"container-title-short":"Quaternary Science Reviews"},

The maximum Hg concentration (498 ng/g at a depth of 4.5 cm) coincides with the maximum concentration of anthropogenic Pb (111 μg/g). Age dating of recent peat accumulation using 210Pb (CRS model) shows that the maxima in Hg and Pb concentrations occur at AD 1954 ± 2. These results, combined with the isotopic composition of Pb in that sample (206Pb/207Pb = 1.1720 ± 0.0017), suggest that coal burning was the dominant source of both elements. From the onset of peat accumulation (ca. 4286 BC) until AD 1385, the ratios Hg/Br and Hg/Se were constant (2.2 ± 0.5 × 10-4 and 8.5 ± 1.8 × 10-3, respectively). Since then, Hg/Br and Hg/Se values have increased, also reaching their maxima in AD 1954. The age date of the maximum concentrations of anthropogenic Hg and Pb in the Faroe Islands is consistent with a previous study of peat cores from Greenland and Denmark (dated using the atmospheric bomb pulse curve of 14C), which showed maximum concentrations in AD 1953.\n\nThe average rate of atmospheric Hg accumulation from 1520 BC to AD 1385 was 1.27 ± 0.38 μg/m2/yr. The Br and Se concentrations and the background Hg/Br and Hg/Se ratios were used to calculate the average rate of natural Hg accumulation for the same period, 1.32 ± 0.36 μg/m2/yr and 1.34 ± 0.29 μg/m2/yr, respectively. These fluxes are similar to the preanthropogenic rates obtained using peat cores from Switzerland, southern Greenland, southern Ontario, Canada, and the northeastern United States. Episodic volcanic emissions and the continual supply of marine aerosols to the Faroe Islands, therefore, have not contributed significantly to the Hg inventory or the Hg accumulation rates, relative to these other areas. The maximum rate of Hg accumulation was 34 μg/m2/yr. The greatest fluxes of anthropogenic Hg accumulation calculated using Br and Se, respectively, were 26 and 31 μg/m2/yr. The rate of atmospheric Hg accumulation in 1998 (16 μg/m2/yr) is comparable to the values recently obtained by atmospheric transport modeling for Denmark, the Faroe Islands, and Greenland.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703704004508","DOI":"10.1016/j.gca.2004.06.011","ISSN":"0016-7037","author":[{"family":"Shotyk","given":"W."},{"family":"Goodsite","given":"M.

Since 1920, First Lake in Lower Sackville, Nova Scotia has been the focus of significant watershed development, and lake water quality degradation is an ongoing concern. Second lake is located nearby, is of similar size, and is located in an undeveloped watershed. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses and x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy data from lake sediment gravity cores were used to construct a c.600-year record of environmental change for each lake in order to de-couple natural water quality variability from anthropogenically-induced variation. Increases in specific elements (Nb, Y, Sr, Cu) associated with local gold mining were used to cross correlate and date the lake sediment records. Increases in Pb concentrations above background levels were also used for temporal control. Modern water quality data indicated that though both lakes stratify strongly over the summer, First Lake alone experiences hypolimnetic anoxia. Though both lake proxy records indicated significant natural water quality variability, stable isotope (δ13C, δ15N) and XRF (Fe, Mn, Ti) data indicated that First Lake alone was subject to substantial and persistent increases in natural autochthonous productivity during the past 70 years that can be attributed directly to local watershed development. Data indicated that though logging and/or mining as well as commercial development has likely impacted both lakes, residential development has had the strongest negative impact on water quality. This study has shown that the paleolimnological method can be used to quantify the relative impact of different types of development on lake water quality, a fundamental step in developing effective watershed management strategies.","URL":"http://scholar.acadiau.ca/islandora/object/theses:1148","author":[{"family":"Misiuk","given":"Benjamin"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"publisher-place":"Wolfville, NS"},

Since 1920, First Lake in Lower Sackville has been the focus of watershed development and lake water quality degradation is an ongoing concern. A paleolimnological approach was undertaken to provide insight into the relationship between watershed development and water quality. A year-long study of limnological conditions in the lake and a historical survey of existing data were conducted to characterize seasonal physical and chemical lake conditions. First Lake stratifies strongly during the summer and algal blooms and hypolimnic anoxia commonly occur. Survey results indicate that shallow Secchi disk depths (< 2 m), strong stratification (~6 m), neutral pH values, and oxygen-deprived bottom waters (<5%) commonly develop as the summer progresses. A 33 cm long sediment core from the lake basin captured approximately 600 years of sediment accumulation. Atmospheric Pb concentrations were used to approximate sedimentation rates. Pre-development (pre-1920) data indicate a productive, likely mesotrophic lake. Higher δ 15N values and lower C/N ratios near the top of the core indicate increased primary productivity within the lake as a result of increased nutrient input from early agricultural development after 1920. Changes in concentrations of Ti, Cu, K, loss-on-ignition and magnetic susceptibility values indicate landscape instability, and an increase in sediment and toxin transfer into the lake associated with urbanization in 1960. These data indicate that changes in water quality in First Lake are strongly linked to specific anthropogenic activities in the watershed, an understanding of which is a fundamental factor in developing effective lake management strategies.","URL":"http://scholar.acadiau.ca/islandora/object/theses:1014","author":[{"family":"Tymstra","given":"Drake"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"publisher-place":"Wolfville, NS"},

Using a 210Pb and 14C dated sediment core from Alta Lake, Whistler, British Columbia, long-term changes in water quality were reconstructed using C/N stable isotopes, metals, and historical records. Evidence was found for a large-scale influx of terrestrial carbon at 1563±98 AD and channel avulsion on the 21-Mile Creek alluvial fan at 1754±81 AD. Changes in stable isotopes beginning at 1949±17 AD indicated increased productivity in response to nutrient loading from septic-derived nutrients. Increased metal deposition (Cu, As, and Zn) during the same period indicates that watershed disturbance during the construction of the highway was likely a significant contributor of metals to Alta Lake. Previous limnological assessments of Alta Lake concluded that Alta Lake is an oligotrophic, clear-water lake with excellent water quality. This study confirmed these data but indicated that nutrient loading and increased productivity in Alta Lake continue to occur. The application of the paleolimnological method to the assessment of Alta Lake confirmed that the suite of abiotic proxies used was effective in characterizing long-term trends in water quality, and that a long-term perspective on water quality variability is necessary to develop effective management practices for Alta Lake and other small, economically important lakes across Canada.","URL":"http://scholar.acadiau.ca/islandora/object/theses:411","author":[{"family":"Dunnington","given":"Dewey W."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,11]]},"publisher-place":"Wolfville, NS"},

Thesis","abstract":"The Isthmus of Chignecto on the New Brunswick - Nova Scotia border is the location of the Tantramar, Missaguash, and Amherst Marshes, which together form a large coastal wetland system that has been the focus of much ecosystem research and habitat modification even though little is known about the systems’ evolution. In this study, lithostratigraphic and chemostratigraphic lake sediment records from three lakes are used to provide a high resolution record of post-glacial environmental change for the region. Basal dates for the study lakes range from >10,000 cal. yr BP to < 4000 cal. yr BP, indicating that each lake provides a unique story on landscape and salt marsh evolution. Lake sediment stratigraphy indicates rapid fluctuations in lake productivity. Chemostratigraphic proxies indicate fluctuating salinity and oxygen levels in two of the three lakes and show that multiple saltwater incursions likely occurred. Analyses of metals indicate anomalously high pre-historic concentrations of Pb and Hg (8 ppm and 870 ppb respectively). Historic concentrations of Pb and Hg provide evidence for significant atmospheric deposition from industrialization and anthropogenic sources. Collectively, these data suggest that a sophisticated model is required to adequately explain the physical evolution of this extensive wetland system. Periods of sustained saltwater influx into freshwater systems were likely a fundamental driver of systems change. Additionally, both anthropogenic and natural disturbances of the lakes and wetlands have the potential to increase the bioavailability of contaminants. Management of these wetlands must take into account the sensitivity of the wetland system to environmental disturbance.","URL":"http://scholar.acadiau.ca/islandora/object/theses:247","author":[{"family":"White","given":"Hilary E."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"publisher-place":"Wolfville, NS"},

Thesis","abstract":"The Missaguash Bog and Amherst Marsh are situated along the border of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the head of the Bay of Fundy and have a long history of anthropogenic influence. Long Lake and Round Lake are small, shallow lakes in the middle of this marsh system and are influenced by a number of human-induced changes including water control structures, dredging of channels, and increased use through recreation, construction, and forestry. The impact of this activity on Long Lake was studied using paleolimnological methods to link changes in organic content, lead, titanium, and other proxies observed in sediment cores to the known history of the lake basin, leading to a better understanding of how small, shallow lakes react to anthropogenic influence.\nIt was discovered that Long Lake was very sensitive to changes in precipitation, temperature, and lake level. Data from core stratigraphy and historical sources indicate that drainage modification lowered the lake level in Long Lake during the mid-1800s, after which wave action heavily disturbed unconsolidated organic sediment. Deposition resumed with predominantly inorganic sediment, indicating a fundamental change in depositional dynamics. Geochemcial proxy data suggest sediment resuspension and mixing have occurred in the top few centimetres of sediment, possibly due to increased turbulence from motorboat activity.\nThe sediment record from Round Lake provides evidence for significant atmospheric deposition from industrialization in Amherst during the late 1800s and early 1900s.

During the Black Death pandemic, demographic and economic collapse interrupted metal production and atmospheric lead dropped to undetectable levels. This finding challenges current government and industry understanding of preindustrial lead pollution and its potential implications for human health of children and adults worldwide. Available technology and geographic location have limited previous ice core investigations. We provide new high- (discrete, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, ICP-MS) and ultra-high resolution (laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, LA-ICP-MS) records of atmospheric lead deposition extracted from the high Alpine glacier Colle Gnifetti, in the Swiss-Italian Alps. We show that contrary to the conventional wisdom, low levels at or approaching natural background occurred only in a single 4 year period in ~2000 years documented in the new ice core, during the Black Death (~1349–1353 C.E.), the most devastating pandemic in Eurasian history. Ultra-high chronological resolution allows for the first time detailed and decisive comparison of the new glaciochemical data with historical records. Historical evidence shows that mining activity ceased upwind of the core site from ~1349 to 1353, while concurrently on the glacier lead (Pb) concentrations—dated by layer counting confirmed by radiocarbon dating—dropped to levels below detection, an order of magnitude beneath figures deemed low in earlier studies. Previous assumptions about preindustrial “natural” background lead levels in the atmosphere—and potential impacts on humans—have been misleading, with significant implications for current environmental, industrial, and public health policy, as well as for the history of human lead exposure.

Aquatic sediment concentrations of mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), and chromium (Cr) in Long Lake fluctuated substantially and, during some periods, exceeded guidelines for the protection of aquatic life. Increases in lead (Pb), Hg, Cr, trace metals, and nitrogen stable isotopes (δ15N) were broadly coincident with a period of widespread drying from ca. 8000 to 4000 cal BP and were likely a consequence of regional fires. From ca. 4000 cal BP until 1700 AD, metal levels in general were low due to decreased erosion, increased precipitation, and reduced fire activity. Water level lowering and forced sediment aggradation (tiding) in the 1800s led to increases in minerogenic Pb and Cr, though fossil fuel combustion also likely contributed to total Pb concentrations. Stratigraphic proxies indicated increased inorganic sedimentation rates, and reduced autochthonous productivity were coincident with lower Hg and As concentrations in the Long Lake sediment. Our data indicate that natural phenomena (fire) can result in sediment contaminant exceedances, that most metals have multiple sources, and that both human-induced disturbance and emissions have contributed to Pb contamination in the last 200 years. In addition, wetter and generally cooler climate appeared to favour lower concentrations of contaminants in lake sediments. Although wetland sediments in the Cumberland Basin Marshes are not heavily polluted with metals, the development of constructed wetlands and the disruption of aquatic sediments have the potential to concentrate, mobilize, and increase the bioavailability of metals.","URL":"http://www.facetsjournal.com/article/facets-2017-0004/","DOI":"10.1139/facets-2017-0004","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Dunnington","given":"Dewey W."},{"family":"White","given":"Hilary"},{"family":"Spooner","given":"Ian S."},{"family":"Mallory","given":"Mark L."},{"family":"White","given":"Chris"},{"family":"O’Driscoll","given":"Nelson J."},{"family":"McLellan","given":"Nic R."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,23]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,24]]}},

Variations in the percentages of major elements through time are dominated by long-term independent variations in the abundance of SiO2, FeO, and to a lesser extent Ca and Al. Additional variations are caused by varying proportions of inorganic matter. Major variations in chemistry are generally unrelated to documented distrubances in the watersheds; most disturbances are minor fires or selective logging.Accelerated accumulation of Pb from atmospheric sources into sediment first occurs in sediment dated between 1800 and 1850 in NY and NE, slightly later in the NGLS region, and about 1900 in FL. Modern accumulation rates in all areas are comparable (ca. 1 to 4 μg cm−2 yr−1). Accumulation rates of Pb in some lakes have declined significantly from 1975 to 1985. Atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic Zn and Cu is also indicated by generally increasing accumulation rates in sediment cores, but the record is not as clear nor are chemical profiles in all lakes parallel to the trends in atmospheric emissions inferred on the basis of fossil fuel consumption, smelting, and other industrial activities. Inter-lake variations in profiles of Cu and Zn are large. Vanadium accumulation rates increase by the 1940s in NY and NE, but not until the 1950s in the NGLS region. This timing correlates with regional trends in the combustion of fuel oil, a major source of atmospheric V.Acidification of some of the lakes is suggested by decreases in the concentration and accumulation rates of Mn, Ca, and Zn in recent sediment, relative to other elements of catchment origin. The decreases generally occur slightly before the onset of acidification as indicated by diatoms. Increased sediment accumulation rates for Fe may indicate the acidification of watershed soils. The use of the accumulation rate of TiO2 as an indicator of rates of erosion and for normalization of trace metal accumulation rates is in question for lakes where the flux of TiO2 from the atmosphere varies and is a significant fraction of the total flux of TiO2 to the sediment.","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00181714","DOI":"10.1007/BF00181714","ISSN":"0921-2728, 1573-0417","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Norton","given":"Stephen A."},{"family":"Bienert","given":"Ray W."},{"family":"Binford","given":"Michael W."},{"family":"Kahl","given":"Jeffrey S."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1992,1,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,15]]},"container-title-short":"J Paleolimnol"},

The results from hierarchical cluster and principal component analyses revealed four elemental groups. All the trace elements clustering with aluminum, iron, and manganese in Group I were enriched due to increased inputs from anthropogenic sources. The two conservative elements sodium and potassium clustering in Group II showed patterns of changes like those of water-level fluctuations. The two carbonate elements calcium and magnesium clustering in Group III showed intriguing but complex carbonate biogeochemistry associated with biogenic production, organic acid-induced dissolution and dilution by organic and aluminosilicate materials. The terrigenous element titanium in Group IV experienced two stages of depletion from increased organic fluxes in the 1820s and 1950s. Following the enactments of stringent regulations in the early 1970s, many of these elemental inputs have reduced considerably. But the concurrent reductions in the Sandusky basin were much slower than previously thought. Large increases in inputs from local storages (internal loading) were required to account for the slow reductions. The increased internal loading was caused by augmented organic materials from accelerated eutrophication which facilitated the transfer, transport, and cycling of many trace metals. This work has implications in ongoing research efforts to tackle the eutrophication problem because the complex ecosystem including the internal loading has changed considerably over the past two centuries.","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10933-017-9953-3","DOI":"10.1007/s10933-017-9953-3","ISSN":"0921-2728, 1573-0417","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Yuan","given":"Fasong"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,11]]},"container-title-short":"J Paleolimnol"},

The magnitude of legacy contamination in southwestern Pennsylvania, the cradle of North American fossil fuel industrialization, is reconstructed from trace metal concentrations in a sediment core with proxies including major and trace metal chemistry, bulk density, and magnetic susceptibility. Trace metal chemistry in this sediment record reflects 19th and 20th century land use and industry. In particular, early 19th century arsenic loadings to the lake are elevated from pesticides used by early European settlers at a lakeside tannery. Later, sediment barium concentrations rise, likely reflecting the onset of acidic mine drainage from coal operations. Twentieth century zinc, cadmium, and lead concentrations are dominated by emissions from the nearby, infamous Donora Zinc Works yet record both the opening of a nearby coal-fired power plant and amendments to the Clean Air Act. The impact of early industry is substantial and rivals more recent metal fluxes, resulting in a significant potential source of contaminated sediments.

Diatom floristic changes and catchment productivity (carbon isotope ratios) were analysed within the core. Indicators of atmospheric pollution (XRF and SCP inventories) were also measured. Results show a marked transition from a dominant benthic assemblage to a planktonic one (increasing P:B ratios) starting after ca. 1940 AD, becoming most prominent after ca. 1980 AD (P:B > 1). Most notable floristic changes result from the increase in the planktonic species Discostella woltereckii. These changes are concomitant with increased temperature trends from the region and reconstructed temperature anomalies of the Northern Hemisphere. SCP concentrations and flux rates also increase after ca. 1950 AD, with highest values seen at ca. 1980 AD after which values decline. Normalised elemental geochemistry (e.g. Pb/Ti) also show marked changes after ca. 1970 AD, most likely derived from atmospheric deposition of Pb. The recent increase in D. woltereckii precedes anthropogenic contamination (Pb/Ti) at the site and persists after the decline in SCP concentrations. This suggests that the recent increases are driven by increased mean annual temperature trends. These temperature trends may be manifested as changes in ice cover persistence, a longer growing season and/or increased DOC at Lake Xiaolongwan: conditions for which planktonic species have a more competitive advantage.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618212005290","DOI":"10.1016/j.quaint.2012.07.033","ISSN":"1040-6182","author":[{"family":"Panizzo","given":"Virginia N."},{"family":"Mackay","given":"Anson W."},{"family":"Rose","given":"Neil L."},{"family":"Rioual","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Leng","given":"Melanie J."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,3,21]]},"title-short":"Recent palaeolimnological change recorded in Lake Xiaolongwan, northeast China","container-title-short":"Quaternary International"},

Environmental indicators preserved in the sediment including, geochemical characteristics, pollen, diatoms, soot and charcoal were analyzed in a chronological sequence to document the physical, chemical and biological impacts over time. -- Two broad-scale eras of direct soil disturbance were identified and related to farming and urban growth. During the farming era, between 1750 and 1950, the natural vegetation cover was removed and lake sedimentation rates increased. The urban era, which began about 1910, resulted in rapid soil erosion and high lake sedimentation rates. During the most intense period of urban development, the mid-1960s, the dry sediment influx rate was 160 times pre-European rates. Storm sewers and pavement played an important role in the urban environment, providing a direct path to the lakes for pollutants. -- Superimposed on these disturbances are atmospheric contributions from coal and automobile emissions. Coal combustion, which began about 1800 and increased to the mid-1950s, emitted soot and toxic metals, as observed in the lake sediment records. Automobile pollution, through leaded gasoline combustion, contributed significant levels of lead. Lake sediment records show the highest inputs and concentrations of lead occurred about 1970. Lead isotopic ratios suggest two or three different gasoline types were used in this area. -- The most notable aquatic impact is a pH increase through the last few decades. Reconstructing water pH in Quidi Vidi Lake from diatom assemblages showed that the earliest farming had little influence on the pH, while an increase of about 1.2 units was observed to the 1980s. The recent high pH has been attributed to increased buffering capacity, believed to be caused by an increase in Mg and Ca contributions from the dissolution of concrete in the watershed. -- The long history of coal combustion and leaded gasoline combustion has probably left the local soils charged with soot and heavy metals. Although the extent of influence is unknown, these soils may be continuous suppliers of contaminants for centuries to come.

We measured a combination of bulk sediment geochemistry and stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in a 210Pb- and 14C-dated sediment core from Alta Lake, Whistler, British Columbia. Channel avulsion at AD 1754 ± 81 on the 21-Mile Creek alluvial fan resulted in increased deposition of organic matter with a signal of autochthonous production. A decrease in δ13C beginning at AD 1949 ± 17 indicates an increase in pelagic productivity relative to benthic productivity and/or sewage input to Alta Lake. A corresponding increase in δ15N indicates an increase in sewage-derived nutrients during the same time period. These changes were synchronous and coincide with the onset of rapid development in the Whistler Valley. Increased metal deposition (Cu, As, and Zn) during the same period resulted from watershed disturbance during highway construction. Cu, As, and Zn concentrations correlated positively with C concentrations and negatively with Ti and K, suggesting removal of metals from the water column is closely related to autochthonous organic matter deposition. Fe/Mn ratios and Mo concentrations were expected to respond to hypolimnetic oxygen availability in response to decreased flushing rate and increased productivity following the loss of inflow from 21-Mile Creek, but did not display a clear time-stratigraphic signal.

Average PAH and metal concentrations in the most urbanized watersheds were approximately 30 and 6 times the reference concentrations, respectively, in remote, undeveloped watersheds. One-quarter to one-half of sampling sites had concentrations of PAHs, Cu, Pb, or Zn above the probable effects concentration, a set of sediment quality guidelines for adverse effects to aquatic biota, and sediments were predicted to be toxic, on average, when CIT land use exceeded about 10%. Trends in metals in cores from urban watersheds were dominantly downward, whereas trends in PAHs in a suburban watershed were upward. A regional atmospheric-fallout gradient was indicated by as much as order-of-magnitude-greater concentrations and accumulation rates of contaminants in cores from an undeveloped reference lake in Boston compared to those from remote reference watersheds. Contaminant accumulation rates in the lakes with urbanization in their watersheds, however, were 1–3 orders of magnitude greater than those of reference lakes, which indicate the dominance of local sources and fluvial transport of contaminants to urban lakes.

Temperature inferences from lowland lakes are likely influenced by other variables, specifically eutrophication and industrial pollution, but their reliability has never been tested. We used a Norwegian chironomid-based transfer function (r 2 = 0.91; RMSEP = 1.01 °C) to infer mean July air temperature over the last 200 years, using chironomid assemblages in a core collected from a polluted, nutrient-enriched lake at Speke Hall, Liverpool, England. The chironomid-inferred temperatures correlate significantly with the local instrumental temperature record and follow long-term national temperature trends. These results show that chironomids can be used to produce reliable estimates of past mean July air temperature, even when other variables have also influenced the composition of the chironomid community.

Here, a high-resolution 1,300 year record of metal accumulation is presented from a varved lake sediment on Devon Island in the Canadian High Arctic. Down-core concentration profiles of Cd, Cu and Zn were positively correlated (P < 0.01) with organic C (Cd, Zn) or with leachable Fe (Cu), while distinct sub-surface peaks of these metals coincided with those of Fe, S and other redox-sensitive elements such as Co, Cr and U. The fluxes of these metals since 1854 were correlated with elements such as Ca, Al and La (P < 0.001) which are predominantly of local geological origin. Furthermore, the Cd, Cu and Zn patterns did not match concurrent records in Greenland Summit ice over the last century, nor global industrial emission histories. These facts suggest that inputs from local geological sources, coupled with some degree of post-depositional mobility or association with organic matter inputs, explain the metals’ sedimentary profiles, which were apparently not affected by long-range atmospheric metal pollution. Mercury concentrations were strongly correlated with total diatom abundance over the last 400 yrs, especially during the 20th Century when a two-fold increase in Hg concentrations and a four order-of-magnitude increase in diatoms occurred in tandem. Since 1854, 81% of the variation in Hg flux was associated with diatom and Ca fluxes. A similar correspondence between Hg and diatoms was found in a second lake nearby, confirming that the relationship was not unique to the main study lake. Recent Hg increases in Arctic and sub-Arctic lakes have been attributed to global anthropogenic Hg emissions. We propose an alternative hypothesis for High Arctic lakes: the recent Hg increases may be partly or entirely the product of elevated rates of Hg scavenging from the water column caused by markedly greater algal productivity, which in turn was driven by accelerating climate warming during the 20th Century. Given the important environmental assessment and policy implications if the alternative hypothesis is true, the possible effects of climate warming on sedimentary Hg fluxes in this region deserve further study.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703705004862","DOI":"10.1016/j.gca.2005.06.009","ISSN":"0016-7037","author":[{"family":"Outridge","given":"P.

Assessing the independent effects of climate warming on mercury sequestration is challenging due to temporal overlap between warming temperatures and increased long-range transport of atmospheric mercury following the Industrial Revolution. We address this challenge by examining mercury trends in short cores (the last several hundred years) from eight lakes centered on Cape Herschel (Canadian High Arctic) that span a gradient in microclimates, including two lakes that have not yet been significantly altered by climate warming due to continued ice cover. Previous research on subfossil diatoms and inferred primary production indicated the timing of limnological responses to climate warming, which, due to prevailing ice cover conditions, varied from ∼1850 to ∼1990 for lakes that have undergone changes. We show that climate warming may have enhanced mercury deposition to lake sediments in one lake (Moraine Pond), while another (West Lake) showed a strong signal of post-industrial mercury enrichment without any corresponding limnological changes associated with warming.

This study examines the hatching rate and developmental success of Daphnia hatched from diapausing eggs isolated from sediments from four lakes that experienced varying levels of metal contamination. Two hundred seventy-three animals were hatched from lake sediments deposited over the past century. Hatching rate was negatively influenced by metal contamination and sediment age. There was a robust positive relationship between sediment metal concentrations and juvenile mortality in Daphnia hatching from those sediments. The negative effect of metals on Daphnia hatching and juvenile survival may stem from metal bioaccumulation, genetic effects, or reduced maternal investment in diapausing embryos.

Variations in nutrient cycling and deposition of lithogenic elements were studied, using a multi-proxy stratigraphic approach. Carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotopic analyses were applied in combination with records of hydrocarbons (n-alkanes) to investigate the sources and depositional conditions of sediment organic matter. Changes in fluvial and airborne delivery of inorganic matter were based on X-ray fluorescence measurements. The results reveal that population growth and related increases in land-use pressure had a major impact on catchment erosion and input of terrestrial organic matter to the lakes from the 1500s to the end of the 1800s. Evidence also exists of a brief period of catchment disturbance at ca. 1200–1300, followed by recovery, likely connected to the Black Death pandemic. At ca. 1900 synchronous shifts in most of the proxy records suggest a marked change in external forcing common to the two lakes related to a major decrease in population density and the introduction of modern forestry following the industrial revolution. Interestingly, the two sediment records exhibit generally coherent trends in C/N ratio, organic C content and δ13C, both before and after 1900, indicating broadly similar sensitivities of the lake ecosystems to human impact. In contrast, deviating trends in total N content, δ15N and lithogenic element concentrations (K, Ti, Rb and Zr) reflect site-specific responses to local disturbances during the last century due to different nutrient conditions and catchment properties.

Whole-basin changes in Hg accumulation, determined from lakewide arrays of 210Pb-dated cores, show that regional atmospheric Hg deposition has increased by a factor of 3.7 since preindustrial times. The relative increase is consistent among lakes, although preindustrial Hg accumulation rates range from 4.5 to 9 µg/m2 per year, and modern rates range from 16 to 32 µg/m2 per year. The distribution of these rates is highly correlated with the ratio of catchment area to the lake surface area. Modern and preindustrial atmospheric deposition rates of 12.5 and 3.7 µg/m2 per year are calculated from this relationship, along with the relative contribution of Hg from the terrestrial catchment. Release of atmospheric Hg from catchment soils accounts for 20—40% of the Hg loading to the lakes, depending on catchment size. This export represents about 25% of the atmospheric Hg falling on the catchments under both modern and preindustrial conditions. The absence of geographic trends in either Hg deposition rates or their increase implies regional if not global sources for the Hg entering these lakes.","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1021/ba-1994-0237.ch002","ISBN":"978-0-8412-2526-8","author":[{"family":"Engstrom","given":"Daniel R."},{"family":"Swain","given":"Edward B."},{"family":"Henning","given":"Thomas A."},{"family":"Brigham","given":"Mark E."},{"family":"Brezonik","given":"Patrick L."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1994,5,5]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,14]]},"DOI":"10.1021/ba-1994-0237.ch002"},

Acid leachable and residual elements were extracted from a 37-cm long core (1-cm resolution) using clean techniques and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Organic matter and sulfur concentrations were high and played a major role in the low postdepositional diagenetic remobilization of many trace elements. Sulfur, manganese, iron, arsenic, molybdenum and barium displayed a high mobility making it exceedingly difficult to infer unambiguously time-dependent changes in atmospheric deposition for these elements. Atmospheric deposition rates for the less mobile elements (e.g., potassium, vanadium, chromium, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, rubidium, cadmium, tin, antimony, mercury, thallium, lead, and bismuth) increased regularly between 1942 and 1960–1975 in the Lake Hertel area and then stabilized for most of these elements, with the exception of nickel, copper, zinc and tin. Lead deposition rate was reduced by about 25% between 1982 and 1995, and a slight decreasing trend was also found for cobalt, mercury, and thallium during the same period. Present-day atmospheric deposition of metals directly on the lake surface represents a small percentage of the sedimentary deposition rates at this location. Deposition followed by surface runoff and outwash of terrestrial organic and inorganic matter most likely is the driving mechanism leading to the non-diagenetic enrichment of metals in Lake Hertel sediments.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231099003362","DOI":"10.1016/S1352-2310(99)00336-2","ISSN":"1352-2310","author":[{"family":"Gélinas","given":"Yves"},{"family":"Lucotte","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Schmit","given":"Jean-Pierre"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2000,1,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,14]]},"container-title-short":"Atmospheric Environment"},

All core subsamples were analysed to determine the bulk sediment chemistry; selected subsamples were analysed for trace element partitioning and 137Cs activity. The purpose of these analyses was to determine the trace element concentrations and distributions in the sediment column and to try to establish a trace element geochemical history of the lake in relation to mining and mining-related discharge operations in the area. Substantial portions of the near-surface sediments in Lake Coeur d'Alene are markedly enriched in Ag, As, Cd, Hg, Pb, Sb and Zn, and slightly enriched in Cu, Fe and Mn. Variations in the thickness of the trace element-rich sediments, which range from more than 119 cm to as little as 17 cm, indicate that the source of much of this material is the Coeur d'Alene River. An estimated 75 million tonnes of trace element-rich sediments have been deposited on or in the lake bed. Estimated trace element masses in excess of those considered representative of background conditions range from a high of 468 000 tonnes of Pb to a low of 260 tonnes of Hg. The similarity between the trace element-rich surface and subsurface sediments with respect to their location, their bulk chemistry, their interelement relations and their trace element partitioning indicate that the sources and/or concentrating mechanisms causing the trace element enrichment in the lake sediments have probably been the same through-out their depositional history. Based on a Mt St Helens'ash layer from the 1980 eruption, ages estimated from 137Cs activity and the presence of 80 discernible and presumably annual layers in a core collected near the Coeur d'Alene River delta indicate that deposition rates for the trace element-rich sediments have ranges from 2.1 to 1.3 cm/year. These data also indicate that the deposition of trace element-rich sediments began, at least in the Coeur d'Alene River delta, some time between 1895 and 1910, dates consistent with the onset of mining and ore processing activities that began in the area in the 1880s.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.3360090105","DOI":"10.1002/hyp.3360090105","ISSN":"1099-1085","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Horowitz","given":"Arthur J."},{"family":"Elrick","given":"Kent A."},{"family":"Robbins","given":"John A."},{"family":"Cook","given":"Robert B."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1995,1,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,16]]},"title-short":"Effect of mining and related activities on the sediment trace element geochemistry of Lake Coeur D'Alene, Idaho, USA part II"},

More than half of the lakes have recently been acidified. The results show an increase of Pb deposition starting in the early 1800s. Most of the Pb profiles show a levelling off or slight decrease in the deposition rate in the post-1980 sediments. The first signs of increases of Zn, Cd and Hg typically appear during the 1800s; a prominent increase in the sedimentation of these elements is typically confined to this century. Clear subsurface (2–5 cm) concentration maxima of Zn and Cd were observed in cores from many lakes in south Finland. The maxima are not related to changes in emission and atmospheric deposition. Subtraction of the background fluxes from the total fluxes of the 1980s gives the following percentages for atmospheric deposition: Pb, 74–97% of the total; Cd, 62–92%; Zn, 39–91%; and Hg, 70–89%. These figures apply to southern and central Finland, areas that also have the highest deposition of acidic compounds. In northern Finland the increase in deposition starts later and has remained smaller than in the south. About half of the profiles of Cu and V and a third of the Ni profiles showed increased accumulation, typically after 1950. Recent increases in the concentration and accumulation rates of Na, K and Mg, observed in most cores in southernmost Finland, may also be of atmospheric origin.

Lake Mead in southern Nevada and northern Arizona, USA, is one such lake. To assess variations in chemical histories from 1935 to 1998 for major sub-basins of Lake Mead, four sediment cores were taken from three different parts of the reservoir (two from Las Vegas Bay and one from the Overton Arm and Virgin Basin) and analyzed for major and trace elements, radionuclides, and organic compounds. As expected, anthropogenic contaminant inputs are greatest to Las Vegas Bay reflecting inputs from the Las Vegas urban area, although concentrations are low compared to sediment quality guidelines and to other USA lakes. One exception to this pattern was higher Hg in the Virgin Basin core. The Virgin Basin core is located in the main body of the lake (Colorado River channel) and is influenced by the hydrology of the Colorado River, which changed greatly with completion of Glen Canyon Dam upstream in 1963. Major and trace elements in the core show pronounced shifts in the early 1960s and, in many cases, gradually return to concentrations more typical of pre-1960s by the 1980s and 1990s, after the filling of Lake Powell. The Overton Arm is the sub-basin least effected by anthropogenic contaminant inputs but has a complex 137Cs profile with a series of large peaks and valleys over the middle of the core, possibly reflecting fallout from nuclear tests in the 1950s at the Nevada Test Site. The 137Cs profile suggests a much greater sedimentation rate during testing which we hypothesize results from greatly increased dust fall on the lake and Virgin and Muddy River watersheds. The severe drought in the southwestern USA during the 1950s might also have played a role in variations in sedimentation rate in all of the cores.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018209001175","DOI":"10.1016/j.palaeo.2009.03.017","ISSN":"0031-0182","author":[{"family":"Rosen","given":"Michael R."},{"family":"Van Metre","given":"Peter C."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,8,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,16]]},"container-title-short":"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology"},

The interpretation of sedimentary metal profiles as historical records may be complex, however, as these profiles may be influenced by a variety of chemical, physical, and biological processes occurring naturally near the sediment-water interface. We used several independent approaches to distinguish the anthropogenic from the natural contributions in sediment metal profiles. A first approach compares metal profiles obtained in chemically similar lakes exposed to high and low metal loads from the atmosphere. A second approach uses geochemical and diagenetic modelling to evaluate the importance of metal diffusion as an internal remobilization process. Lastly, stable Pb isotopes are used to fingerprint possible sources of Pb to lake sediments and to evaluate their relative importance.

Despite similar sources in the two basins, the As profiles in the sediments differed markedly. Differences include the following: (i) As concentrations increased sharply upward close to the sediment surface in the perennially oxic basin due to scavenging of upward diffusing As by Fe oxyhydroxides, whereas they decreased in the seasonally anoxic basin where As scavenging by Fe oxyhydroxides did not occur, and (ii) the magnitude and position of major subsurface As maxima differed between the two basins. We applied a one-dimensional transport-reaction equation to porewater As concentration profiles obtained at the two sites to estimate sedimentary As concentrations at the time of deposition as well as subsequent addition or removal of As at various sediment depths. By multiplying As concentrations at the time of deposition by sediment mass accumulation rates, we were able to estimate variations in As fluxes at the sediment surface over the last two centuries. These fluxes were then transformed into atmospheric As deposition fluxes by applying a correction for basin-specific processes using the ratio of expected from atmospheric deposition to measured unsupported 210Pb inventories at the sampling sites. The resulting chronological profiles of atmospheric fluxes of As deposition are similar in both basins, and are consistent with both the history of specific markers for coal combustion and direct historical measurements of As in dry and wet atmospheric deposition in rural areas of North America.

This information, as well as an extensive dataset comprising ancillary geochemical measurements on porewaters and sediment and the population densities of benthic animals, is used in a one-dimensional transport-reaction diagenetic model to investigate the transport and mobilization of Pb in these sediments. Application of the model consistently indicates the presence of a zone of Pb production to the porewaters that lies above a zone of Pb consumption. The profiles of various porewater constituents and thermodynamic calculations indicate that Pb is mobilized in the zone of production by the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydroxides, whereas it is removed in the zone of consumption by precipitation as a solid sulfide. Rate constants are estimated for reductive iron dissolution (kdFe(III) = 2.0 ± 0.5 × 10−1 cm3 mol−1 s−1), Pb adsorption on iron oxyhydroxides (kadsPb = 98 ± 55 cm3 mol−1 s−1), and Pb precipitation (kpptPb = 8 × 10−20 mol cm−3 s−1 to 16 ± 13 × 10−22 mol cm−3 s−1, depending on the solubility product assumed for the precipitation of PbS).

The vertical distribution of HgT, MeHg, acid volatile sulfide, total S, Fe, Mn, Al and organic C were also determined in dated sediment cores from the same lake basins and from the deepest site of two other lakes, one also located in the Canadian Shield and the other in the Northeastern part of the Appalachian Mountains. Application of a one-dimensional transport-reaction equation to the dissolved HgT and MeHg profiles constrains the depth intervals (zones) where these species are produced or consumed in the sedimentary column and yields estimates of net reaction rates of HgT or MeHg in each of the zones as well as their fluxes at the sediment–water interface. Dissolved HgT and MeHg diffused from the overlying water into the sediments, except for MeHg at one of the sampling dates in the perennially oxygenated basin. About 97% and 50% of the MeHg flux to the sediments is presently deposited with settling particles in the perennially oxygenated and seasonally anoxic basins, respectively. Removal of porewater HgT and MeHg occurred at all dates and sampling sites. Comparison of the consumption zones of porewater HgT and MeHg with the profiles of ancillary parameters, coupled with thermodynamic calculations, suggest that pure Hg mineral phases do not form in the sediments, that HgT and MeHg adsorption onto authigenic Fe oxyhydroxides occurs in minor proportions, and that the association of HgT and MeHg to Fe sulfide phases or sulfidized organic matter is possible. Assuming that the net consumption of MeHg in the porewaters was essentially due to demethylation, an apparent first-order rate constant for MeHg demethylation of 0.04–0.8d−1 was estimated.

In this extensive case study, the stability of sedimentary Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn profiles was assessed in dated sediment cores that were collected in 2004 from four smelter-affected lakes near Flin Flon, Manitoba, which had previously been cored in 1985. Metal profiles determined in 1985 were in most cases clearly reproduced in the corresponding sediment layers in 2004, although small-scale spatial heterogeneity in metal distribution complicated the temporal comparisons. Pre-smelter (i.e. pre-1930) increases in metal profiles were likely the result of long-range atmospheric metal pollution, coupled with particle mixing at the 1930s sediment surface. However, the close agreement between key inflection points in the metal profiles sampled two decades apart suggests that metals in most of the lakes, and Hg and Zn in the most contaminated lake (Meridian), were stable once the sediments were buried below the surface mixed layer. Cadmium, Cu and Pb profiles in Meridian Lake did not agree as well between studies, showing evidence of upward remobilization over time. Profiles of redox-indicator elements (Fe, Mn, Mo and U) suggested that the rate of Mn oxyhydroxide recycling within sediment was more rapid in Meridian Lake, which may have caused the Cd, Cu and Pb redistribution.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969713003021","DOI":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.03.011","ISSN":"0048-9697","author":[{"family":"Percival","given":"J.

Using 14C to precisely date samples since ca. AD 1950 using the “atmospheric bomb pulse,” the chronology of Hg accumulation in GL is remarkably similar to the bog in DK where Hg was supplied only by atmospheric deposition: this suggests not only that Hg has been supplied to the surface layers of the minerotrophic core (GL) primarily by atmospheric inputs, but also that the peat cores have preserved a consistent record of the changing rates of atmospheric Hg accumulation. The lowest Hg fluxes in the GL core (0.3 to 0.5 μg/m2/yr) were found in peats dating from AD 550 to AD 975, compared to the maximum of 164 μg/m2/yr in AD 1953. Atmospheric Hg accumulation rates have since declined, with the value for 1995 (14 μg/m2/yr) comparable to the value for 1995 obtained by published studies of atmospheric transport modelling (12 μg/m2/yr). The greatest rates of atmospheric Hg accumulation in the DK core are also found in the sample dating from AD 1953 and are comparable in magnitude (184 μg/m2/yr) to the GL core; again, the fluxes have since gone into strong decline. The accumulation rates recorded by the peat core for AD 1994 (14 μg/m2/yr) are also comparable to the value for 1995 obtained by atmospheric transport modelling (18 μg/m2/yr). Comparing the Pb/Ti and As/Ti ratios of the DK samples with the corresponding crustal ratios (or “natural background values” for preanthropogenic peat) shows that the samples dating from 1953 also contain the maximum concentration of “excess” Pb and As. The synchroneity of the enrichments of all three elements (Hg, Pb, and As) suggests a common source, with coal-burning the most likely candidate. Independent support for this interpretation was obtained from the Pb isotope data (206Pb/207Pb = 1.1481 ± 0.0002 in the leached fraction and 1.1505 ± 0.0002 in the residual fraction) which is too radiogenic to be explained in terms of gasoline lead alone, but compares well with values for U.K. coals. In contrast, the lowest values for 206Pb/207Pb in the DK profile (1.1370 ± 0.0003 in the leached fraction and 1.1408 ± 0.0003 in the residual fraction) are found in the sample dating from AD 1979: this shows that the maximum contribution of leaded gasoline occurred approximately 25 yr after the zenith in total anthropogenic Pb deposition.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703703004095","DOI":"10.1016/S0016-7037(03)00409-5","ISSN":"0016-7037","author":[{"family":"Shotyk","given":"W."},{"family":"Goodsite","given":"M.

Chemical analyses of the pore waters and the peats document the increasingly minerogenic character with depth. In particular, the Sr concentration profile in the peats reflects the growing importance of mineral sediment dissolution with increasing distance below the peat surface. Despite this circumstance, Pb concentrations are greatest in the surface layers, and decrease with depth. Thus, dissolution of the basal sediments at these sites appears to be an unimportant source of Pb, compared with atmospheric deposition. Twenty-one new radiocarbon age dates for the three cores provide a chronology of Pb enrichment, and these are consistent with the record of atmospheric Pb deposition recorded by the ombrotrophic peat bog ‘Etang de la Gruère’ (EGR). Sediment samples from TGE and EGR were reacted at pH 5 with ammonium acetate to dissolve the carbonate fraction, filtered, and the residues analyzed using XRF. These analyses show that much of the Ca, Mg, Sr and Mn is lost when the carbonate fraction is dissolved, but this process does not measurably affect Pb. This finding suggests that carbonate dissolution dominates the weathering of the sediments underlying these peat deposits, but this fraction does not contain significant concentrations of Pb. Minerogenic peat deposits such as those described here, therefore, can serve as reliable archives of atmospheric Pb deposition, provided that mineral dissolution in the underlying sediments does not contribute measurably to the Pb inventory of the peat profile.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896970200030X","DOI":"10.1016/S0048-9697(02)00030-X","ISSN":"0048-9697","author":[{"family":"Shotyk","given":"W"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,6,20]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,26]]},"container-title-short":"Science of The Total Environment"},

Ice cores collected from the Upper Fremont Glacier (UFG), Wyoming, contain a high-resolution record of total atmospheric Hg deposition (ca. 1720−1993). Total Hg in 97 ice-core samples was determined with trace-metal clean handling methods and low-level analytical procedures to reconstruct the first and most comprehensive atmospheric Hg deposition record of its kind yet available from North America. The record indicates major atmospheric releases of both natural and anthropogenic Hg from regional and global sources. Integrated over the past 270-year ice-core history, anthropogenic inputs contributed 52%, volcanic events 6%, and background sources 42%. More significantly, during the last 100 years, anthropogenic sources contributed 70% of the total Hg input.

Cumulative Hg inventories from each core (for the past ∼150yr) varied by a factor of 1.4 (13.6–18.5mgHgm−2), indicating variations of net Hg accumulation rate within the peat deposit. Historical changes in vegetation cover (leading to variable interception by trees) are probably responsible for this variation in space and time. The uncorrected Hg accumulation rates peaked between the 1960s and 1980s (up to 226μgm−2yr−1). Recent findings show that Hg records from peat tend to overestimate historical levels of Hg deposition. Therefore we used the mass loss compensation factor (MLCF) to normalize Hg accumulation rates. These corrected Hg accumulation rates were significantly lower (maximum 129μgm−2yr−1) and better corresponded to changes in historical smelter emissions, which were highest in the 1960s. The agreement between the corrected Hg accumulation rates in the uppermost peat sections (2–38μgm−2yr−1) and biomonitoring of atmospheric deposition by mosses in several recent years (4.7–34.4μgm−2yr−1) shows the usefulness of MLCF application on Hg accumulation in peat archives.

Mercury was determined using a LECO-ALTEC AMA-254 analyzer, Pb with an EMMA-XRF analyzer and stable lead isotopes (four cores) by Quadrupole ICP-MS. Maximum concentrations were 74–122μgg−1 for Pb and 142–300ngg−1 for Hg. Higher variability was found for Hg than for Pb (2–3 times and 1.5 times, respectively). The slopes of the relationship between Hg and Pb cumulative inventories also suggested differences in relative accumulation of both elements. This substantial spatial variability indicates that, compared with Pb, a more extended sampling may be needed for an accurate estimation of Hg accumulation in mires. The isotopic records showed higher and almost constant 206Pb/207Pb ratios (average 1.174±0.004) in the lower sections and a continuous decrease to the surface (minimum 1.141). By using the change in the isotopic composition of Pb we estimated a chronology for the last ∼200years which enabled and approximation of the temporal trends in metal pollution. Based on the average isotopic composition of the studied cores and the application of a simple binary mixing model, six periods with increasing proportions of pollution Pb were identified: prior to ∼1875 AD, with an average proportion lower than 16%; ∼1875–1910 AD, increasing up to 24%; ∼1910–1950 AD, up to 35%; ∼1950–1970, up to 54%; ∼1970–1980 AD, up to 74%; and after ∼1980 AD, increasing up to 80%. The period with the highest rate of increase in recent (since ∼1900 AD) pollution Pb (equivalent to 2% year−1) seems to have started at the maximum in Pb accumulation around the early 1970s. The Hg records showed a more simple evolution with four main phases: prior to ∼1875 AD with enrichments around 1.5-fold the background, ∼1875–1955 AD with increasing enrichments; from ∼1955 AD to ∼1980 AD with maximum values (up to 4.2-fold); and from ∼1980 AD to present, with a steady decline to 2.4-fold. For the most recent period (after ∼1980 AD), the combination of decreasing Pb and Hg concentrations and accumulation rates/enrichments, and low 206Pb/207Pb ratios, may point to a higher relative importance of local sources (i.e. coal burning in a nearby power plant) in atmospheric metal pollution in the area.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703711001414","DOI":"10.1016/j.gca.2010.12.025","ISSN":"0016-7037","author":[{"family":"Cortizas","given":"A.

We estimate that anthropogenic emissions in the US and Canada account for 28–33% of contemporary atmospheric deposition in this region, with the rest from natural (14–32%) and global sources (41–53%).","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749108000213","DOI":"10.1016/j.envpol.2008.01.021","ISSN":"0269-7491","author":[{"family":"Sunderland","given":"Elsie M."},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Mark D."},{"family":"Selin","given":"Noelle E."},{"family":"Chmura","given":"Gail L."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,11,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,26]]},"container-title-short":"Environmental Pollution"},

Most of the sampling was conducted as part of the National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program. The primary objective of the study was to determine trends in particle-associated contaminants in response to urbanization; 47 of the 56 lakes are in or near one of 20 U.S. cities. Sampling was done with gravity, piston, and box corers from boats and push cores from boats or by wading, depending on the depth of water and thickness of sediment being sampled. Chemical analyses included major and trace elements, organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, cesium-137, and lead-210. Age-dating of the cores was done on the basis of radionuclide analyses and the position of the pre-reservoir land surface in the reservoir and, in a few cases, other chemical or lithologic depth-date markers. Dates were assigned in many cores on the basis of assumed constant mass accumulation between known depth-date markers. Dates assigned were supported using a variety of other date markers including first occurrence and peak concentrations of DDT and polychlorinated biphenyls and peak concentration of lead. A qualitative rating was assigned to each core on the basis of professional judgment to indicate the reliability of age assignments. A total of 122 cores were collected from the 56 lakes and age dates were assigned to 113 of them, representing 54 of the 56 lakes. Seventy-four of the 122 cores (61 percent) received a good rating for the assigned age dates, 28 cores (23 percent) a fair rating, and 11 cores (9 percent) a poor rating; nine cores (7 percent) had no dates assigned. An analysis of the influence of environmental factors on the apparent quality of age-dating of the cores concluded that the most important factor was the mass accumulation rate (MAR) of sediment: the greater the MAR, the better the temporal discretization in the samples and the less important the effects of postdepositional sediment disturbance. These age-dated sediment cores provide the basis for local-, regional-, and national-scale interpretations of water-quality trends.","URL":"http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20045184","number":"2004-5184","author":[{"family":"Van Metre","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Jennifer T."},{"family":"Fuller","given":"Christopher C."},{"family":"Callender","given":"Edward"},{"family":"Mahler","given":"Barbara J."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,20]]},"DOI":"10.3133/sir20045184"},

The ratio of modern HgT flux to preindustrial HgT flux in sediments ranged from 1.6 to 5.7, with an average value of 3.5. The lake cores showed an increase in sediment HgT flux with increasing ratio of watershed area to lake surface area.

Thesis","source":"scholar.acadiau.ca","abstract":"Dams are prevalent throughout North American river systems and affect river hydrology, and aquatic and terrestrial ecology. The decline in abundance of many anadromous fish species on the east coast of North America has been partially attributed to the presence of dams, and their effect on critical habitat and river connectivity. Obstruction of anadromous fish migrations has broad ecological effects, including reduced biotransport of Marine Derived Nutrients (MDN) into freshwater systems. Technical fishways have been used since the beginning of the 20th century to mitigate the effects of dams on migrating fishes. However, studies of the effectiveness and dynamics of fish passage began only recently, and most fishways remain unstudied. In this study, I assess fishway passage efficiency based on Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) telemetry. During 2013 to 2016, from 24 April to10 June; 5,423 Alewife with a mean fork-length of 227 (± SD of 18) mm were tagged with PIT tags in three rivers on the Isthmus of Chignecto, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, Canada. Measurements of passage and attraction efficiency were calculated for each fishway and Generalized Linear Models (GLM) were applied to determine how variables such as fish length, sex, and the number of years post-tagging were related to Alewife passage efficiency. During their year of tagging, approximately half of individuals (40 -64%) were not detected. Alewife that were detected used fishways from 16 April to 8 July. Attraction rates to fishway entrances in 2013 and 2016 ranged from 85% to 98% and fishway passage rates ranged from 0.5% to 97%. Larger individuals, males and previously tagged returnees, had higher passage success indicating that some fishways apply population-level selective pressures for size, sex and age. Alewife had greater passage in two Denil style fishways than in the single pool-and-weir style fishway. I also attempted to quantify historical MDN transfer by Alewife into lakes associated with these rivers using paleolimnological methods. One sediment core was taken from each of two lakes and was analyzed using Stable Isotope Analysis (SIA) and X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF). However, the rivers chosen for the analysis did not have historical records of fish abundance, so a baseline against which the new SIA data could be compared was not available. The methods and results presented here can be used to guide future research. Marine sediment in both cores showed a change in the concentration of S, 34S, 13C, 14N, K and Ba/Ca ratio, which could (along with other potential marine proxies such as Sr) be used to measure relative MDN input by anadromous fish. Any such projects should use similar lakes with known Alewife abundances and records of land use and alteration to effectively apply the methods presented here and determine historical input of MDN from Alewife during their spawning run.","URL":"https://scholar.acadiau.ca/islandora/object/theses%3A2701/","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Nau","given":"George"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,1]]}},

Thesis","source":"scholar.acadiau.ca","abstract":"Sediments in wetlands and lakes have the potential to retain metals that have been mobilized by natural and anthropogenic disturbance. The role of variable water column chemistry and nutrient loads on metal retention and mobility in wetland and lake sediments is not well understood. Laytons Lake is a coastal freshwater lake located in the Amherst Point Migratory Bird Sanctuary in Nova Scotia, Canada. It experienced a series of marine inundations from the Bay of Fundy in the 1940s. In the late 1970s, researchers identified that the lake was density stratified and incompletely mixed (meromictic), which resulted in a strong chemocline and elevated conductivity levels within 3m of lake bottom sediments. A detailed paleolimnological assessment was undertaken to investigate the geochemical impact of meromixis on lake bottom sediment geochemistry, and the rate of transition from a meromictic to an intermixing state. A geochemical analysis of lake bottom sediments was accomplished by measuring total C, N and stable isotopes (δ15N, and δ13C), and using pXRF to measure elemental proxies. A total Pb curve was used to date the sediment coretemporally. It appears that Laytons Lake is no longer density stratified. A distinct chemoclineno longer exists, as only a small concentration of conductivity (1012 μScm) was detected at the bottom of the deep basin. Data from this study suggests that the lake recovered rapidly from the marine inundation and that meromixis had a very limited effect on the bulk geochemistry of the sediment archive. C/N ratios suggest that the organic matter found in the lake bottom sediment is largely from terrestrial source. This study demonstrated that in a macrotidal environment, the water and sediment chemistry of low-lying coastal lakes may be much more variable and dynamic than lakes situated farther inland, away from occasional marine inundation.","URL":"https://scholar.acadiau.ca/islandora/object/theses%3A2705/","language":"en","author":[{"family":"McGuire","given":"Heather E."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,1]]}},

We analyzed the concentration of lead, titanium, magnesium, iron, and organic matter in sediment cores recovered from three lakes located near mine pits to investigate the timing, location, and magnitude of ancient copper mining pollution. Lead concentrations were normalized to lithogenic metals and organic matter to account for processes that can influence natural (or background) lead delivery. Nearly simultaneous lead enrichments occurred at Lake Manganese and Copper Falls Lake ∼8000 and 7000 years before present (yr BP), indicating that copper extraction occurred concurrently in at least two locations on the peninsula. The poor temporal coherence among the lead enrichments from ∼6300 to 5000 yr BP at each lake suggests that the focus of copper mining and annealing shifted through time. In sediment younger than ∼5000 yr BP, lead concentrations remain at background levels at all three lakes, excluding historic lead increases starting ∼150 yr BP. Our work demonstrates that lead emissions associated with both the historic and Old Copper Complex tradition are detectable and can be used to determine the temporal and geographic pattern of metal pollution.","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1021/es304499c","DOI":"10.1021/es304499c","ISSN":"0013-936X","author":[{"family":"Pompeani","given":"David P."},{"family":"Abbott","given":"Mark B."},{"family":"Steinman","given":"Byron A."},{"family":"Bain","given":"Daniel J."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,6,4]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,1]]},"container-title-short":"Environ.

This has been associated with deleterious effects to ecosystem processes and human health. The magnitude of this toxic metal burden, as well as the spatial and temporal patterns of metal enrichment, is recorded in sedimentary archives across the globe. This paper presents a compilation of selected Pb contamination records from lakes (n = 10), peat mires (n = 10) and ice fields (n = 7) from Europe, North and South America, Asia, Australia and the Northern and Southern Hemisphere polar regions. These records quantify changes in Pb enrichment in remote from source environments. The presence of anthropogenic Pb in the environment has a long history, extending as far back as the early to mid-Holocene in North America, Europe and East Asia. However, results show that Pb contamination in the Earth's environment became globally ubiquitous at the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution (c.1850–1890 CE), after which the magnitude of Pb contamination increased significantly. This date therefore serves as an effective global marker for the onset of the Anthropocene. Current global average Pb enrichment rates are between 6 and 35 times background, however Pb contamination loads are spatially variable. For example, they are >100 times background in Europe and North America and 5–15 times background in Antarctica. Despite a recent decline in Pb loads in some regions, most notably Europe and North America, anthropogenic Pb remains highly enriched and universally present in global ecosystems, while concentrations are increasing in some regions (Australia, Asia and parts of South America and Antarctica). There is, however, a paucity of Pb enrichment records outside of Europe, which limits assessments of global contamination.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749116301014","DOI":"10.1016/j.envpol.2016.02.006","ISSN":"0269-7491","author":[{"family":"Marx","given":"Samuel K."},{"family":"Rashid","given":"Shaqer"},{"family":"Stromsoe","given":"Nicola"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,1]]},"container-title-short":"Environmental Pollution"},

A previous investigation conducted in the same location recorded atmospheric lead (Pb) pollution after ~1845, with peak values recorded in the 1970s, and concluded that a North American source was most likely. To confirm the origin of the lead, we present new Pb isotope data from Sandhavn, together with a high-resolution record for mercury (Hg) deposition. Results demonstrate that the mercury accumulation rate has steadily increased since the beginning of the 19th century, with maximum values of 9.3μgm−2yr−1 recorded ~1940. Lead isotopic ratios show two mixing lines: one which represents inputs from local and regional geogenic sources, and another that comprises regional geogenic and pollution sources. Detrending the Pb isotopic ratio record (thereby extracting the effect of the geogenic mixing) has enabled us to reconstruct a detailed chronology of metal pollution. The first sustained decrease in Pb isotope signals is recorded as beginning ~1740–1780 with the lowest values (indicating the highest pollution signature) dated to ~1960–1970. The 206Pb/207Pb ratio of excess Pb (measuring 1.222, and reflecting pollution-generated Pb), when compared with the Pb isotopic composition of the Sandhavn peat record since the 19th century and the timing of Pb enrichments, clearly points to the dominance of pollution sources from North America, although it did not prove possible to further differentiate the emissions sources geographically.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717323847","DOI":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.09.041","ISSN":"0048-9697","author":[{"family":"Pérez-Rodríguez","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Silva-Sánchez","given":"Noemí"},{"family":"Kylander","given":"Malin E."},{"family":"Bindler","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Mighall","given":"Tim M."},{"family":"Schofield","given":"J.

By combining a range of geochemical and chronological proxies we investigated (1) the importance of PHTE (Potentially Harmful Trace Element) accumulation during pre-industrial times compared to recent accumulation, and (2) the intimate relationship between landscape use and terrestrial PHTE transfers. We show how long human-environment interaction in mountain environments and pre-industrial anthropogenic activities led to PHTE accumulation equal to or even exceeding that of modern times. Atmospheric contamination by PHTE occurred throughout 500 BC − AD 500 for lead (Pb) and antimony (Sb), AD 1200–1600 for only Pb, and the last 150 years for Pb, Sb and copper (Cu) combined. Lead isotopes allowed determination of the impact of Pb contamination from significant local mining and metallurgical activities during the Middle Ages. An estimation of PHTE inventories derived from atmospheric deposition suggests that 85% of Pb accumulation occurred before AD 1800, thus highlighting the influence of past local activities to the accumulation of atmospheric contaminants compared to that of more recent periods. Enhanced erosion input to one of the mires is evident from AD 1600 to 1950, and intensive grazing coupled with forest clearings are the likely cause of these rapid transfers of natural PHTE and previously stored Pb to downstream mires. Remobilized Pb in the impacted peatland represent at least one third of the total Pb-inventory, suggesting that terrestrial transfers were important and acting as hotspot sources of PHTE accumulation.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213305417300449","DOI":"10.1016/j.ancene.2017.09.002","ISSN":"2213-3054","author":[{"family":"Hansson","given":"Sophia V."},{"family":"Claustres","given":"Adrien"},{"family":"Probst","given":"Anne"},{"family":"De Vleeschouwer","given":"François"},{"family":"Baron","given":"Sandrine"},{"family":"Galop","given":"Didier"},{"family":"Mazier","given":"Florence"},{"family":"Le Roux","given":"Gaël"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,1]]},"title-short":"Atmospheric and terrigenous metal accumulation over 3000 years in a French mountain catchment","container-title-short":"Anthropocene"},

The greatest Pb concentrations were found in samples dating from the Younger Dryas. Despite the large range in Pb concentrations (from 2.2 to 181 pg g−1), the Pb concentrations were proportional to those of Sc until 3100 BP when the Pb/Sc ratio exceeded by a factor of 2 the natural “background” value (Pb/Sc = 6.3 ± 1.8) for the first time. The uniform ratio of Pb to Sc until 3100 BP is consistent with the hypothesis that soil dust particles derived from physical and chemical weathering dominate the inputs of Pb to the atmosphere, with the magnitude of these sources climate-dependent. Isotopic analyses of Pb further support this paradigm, with the average ratio of 206Pb/207Pb (1.230) and 208Pb/206Pb (2.059) well within the range given for the Upper Continental Crust (UCC). The shift to higher Pb/Sc ratios and lower 206Pb/207Pb values starting at 3100 BP is consistent with historical records and other archival evidence of the onset of atmospheric Pb contamination caused by Pb mining and smelting in the Iberian Peninsula. Since that time, the Devon Island ice core records several other episodes of notable atmospheric Pb contamination, including those dating from Roman and medieval times, as well as the industrial period.

Everest ice cores has the potential to identify sources and source regions affecting natural and anthropogenic Pb deposition in central Asia. The results show that the regional natural background Pb isotope signature (~1.20 for 206Pb/207Pb and ~2.50 for 208Pb/207Pb) in the central Himalayas was dominated by mineral dust over the last ~750years from 1205 to 1960s, mostly originating from local sources with occasional contributions of long-range transported dust probably from Sahara desert and northwestern India. Since the 1970s, the Pb isotope ratios are characterized by a continuous decline toward less radiogenic ratios with the least mean ratios of 1.178 for 206Pb/207Pb and 2.471 for 208Pb/207Pb in the period 1990–1996. The depression of the 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb values during the corresponding periods is most likely due to an increasing influence of less radiogenic Pb of anthropogenic origin mainly from leaded gasoline used in South Asia (India as well as possibly Bangladesh and Nepal). From 1997 to 2002, isotopic composition tends to show a shift to slightly more radiogenic signature. This is likely attributed to reducing Pb emissions from leaded gasoline in source regions, coinciding with the nationwide reduction of Pb in gasoline and subsequent phase-out of leaded gasoline in South Asia since 1997. An interesting feature is the relatively high levels of Pb concentrations and enrichment factors (EF) between 1997 and 2002. Although the reason for this feature remains uncertain, it would be probably linked with an increasing influence of anthropogenic Pb emitted from other sources such as fossil fuel combustion and non-ferrous metal production.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969711011600","DOI":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.10.002","ISSN":"0048-9697","author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Khanghyun"},{"family":"Hur","given":"Soon Do"},{"family":"Hou","given":"Shugui"},{"family":"Burn-Nunes","given":"Laurie J."},{"family":"Hong","given":"Sungmin"},{"family":"Barbante","given":"Carlo"},{"family":"Boutron","given":"Claude F."},{"family":"Rosman","given":"Kevin J.

On the basis of Pb isotopic composition (e.g., 206Pb/207Pb), clear indications of Pb contamination during the pre-Roman/Roman, post-Roman and medieval periods were attributed to the mining and smelting of Pb ores from Britain and elsewhere in Europe. Between the 17th and early 20th centuries, during the industrial period, the mining and smelting of indigenous Scottish Pb ores were the most important sources of anthropogenic Pb deposition at three of the sites. In contrast, at the most southerly site, influences from the use of both British Pb ores and imported Australian Pb ores (in more southern parts of Britain) since the late 19th century were evident. At each of the sites, Australian-Pb-influenced car exhaust emissions (from the 1930s to late 1990s), along with significant contributions from coal combustion (until the late 1960s and onset of the postindustrial period), were evident. Atmospheric anthropogenic Pb deposition across Scotland was greatest (∼10 to 40 mg m−2 a−1) between the late 1880s and late 1960s, increasing southward, declining to 0.44 to 5.7 mg m−2 a−1 by the early 2000s. The records from four peat bogs extend knowledge of the chronology of atmospheric Pb deposition trends across the northern hemisphere, there being general agreement with other environmental archive records from not only Scotland but also other countries in western Europe and Greenland. Nevertheless, during all periods investigated here, the isotopic composition of atmospheric Pb deposition across western Europe and Greenland exhibited variations in the relative importance of different sources of anthropogenic Pb, as well as some differences in timings and magnitudes of anthropogenic Pb contamination, arising from variations in local and regional sources of Pb deposition and possibly climatic regimes.","URL":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2007GB003059","DOI":"10.1029/2007GB003059","ISSN":"1944-9224","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Cloy","given":"J.

However, long-term records of atmospheric Pb isotopic trends in Asia are still sparse. Consequently, we study changes in the concentrations, fluxes and isotopic signature of deposited Pb contained in a 14C-dated peat core from the eastern Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau, dating back to 9.5kyr BP, and present the first peat record of the changing isotopic composition of atmospheric Pb in dust in Asia during this time. Lead concentrations and fluxes vary between 2.96–21.58μgg−1 and 0.06–3.52mgm−2y−1, respectively, with an average Pb baseline of 6.80±4.18μgg−1. These values agree with other Pb studies of lake and peat archives in China but are one order of magnitude larger than early and mid-Holocene values measured in Europe. Lead isotopic variability throughout the core is small, varying between 206Pb/207Pb=1.190–1.197, 206Pb/204Pb=18.648–18.786, 207Pb/204Pb=15.666–15.694 and 208Pb/204Pb=38.890–39.090. The application of Bayesian trans-dimensional changepoint modelling to the Pb dataset enabled the identification of eight significant changes in the isotopic composition of the deposited Pb. Such changes mark different phases of atmospheric Pb deposition, and hence variations in atmospheric circulation patterns and environmental conditions. Temporal variations in the potential natural and/or anthropogenic Pb sources are assessed based on the 206Pb, 207Pb, 208Pb and 204Pb isotopic composition and the 1/[Pb] ratio of the peat samples. Our results suggest that Pb deposition throughout the Holocene was governed by local deposition and long-range input from natural dust sources in northwestern (Taklamakan desert and Qaidam basin) and northern China (Badain Jaran and Tengger deserts). Input from the northern sources seems to have been particularly important between 3.1–2.7kyr BP and 1.7–0.9kyr BP, suggesting a possible strengthening of the East Asian winter monsoon, in agreement with previous reconstructions in Asia. Based on the Pb/Sc and isotopic composition profiles we do not note any evidence for anthropogenic Pb derived from the thriving mining or smelting activities in northern and eastern China in the last few millennia, suggesting that atmospheric deposition to this region of the eastern Tibetan Plateau was dominated by natural Pb fluxes.

Our results confirm that the combination of radiogenic isotopes (Pb) and trace elements in peat bogs enables observational reconstructions of changes in past regional atmospheric circulation. Such records will enable more refined interpretations of marine and terrestrial palaeorecords in Asia and the Pacific and consequently provide further constraints for changes in ocean and atmospheric circulation and for the testing of palaeoclimate models of circulation patterns.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703711001384","DOI":"10.1016/j.gca.2010.10.031","ISSN":"0016-7037","author":[{"family":"Ferrat","given":"Marion"},{"family":"Weiss","given":"Dominik J."},{"family":"Dong","given":"Shuofei"},{"family":"Large","given":"David J."},{"family":"Spiro","given":"Baruch"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Youbin"},{"family":"Gallagher","given":"Kerry"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,4,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,2]]},"container-title-short":"Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta"},

However, it is still unknown how far atmospheric emissions from these activities have been transported. Since the timing of metallurgical activities is currently estimated from scarce archaeological discoveries, the availability of reliable and continuous records to refine the timing of past metal deposition in South America is essential, as it provides an alternative to discontinuous archives, as well as evidence for global trace metal transport. We show in a peat record from Tierra del Fuego that anthropogenic metals likely have been emitted into the atmosphere and transported from NSA to southern South America (SSA) over the last 4200 yrs. These findings are supported by modern time back-trajectories from NSA to SSA. We further show that apparent anthropogenic Cu and Sb emissions predate any archaeological evidence for metallurgical activities. Lead and Sn were also emitted into the atmosphere as by-products of Inca and Spanish metallurgy, whereas local coal-gold rushes and the industrial revolution contributed to local contamination. We suggest that the onset of pre-Hispanic metallurgical activities is earlier than previously reported from archaeological records and that atmospheric emissions of metals were transported from NSA to SSA.","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111315","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0111315","ISSN":"1932-6203","language":"en","author":[{"family":"De Vleeschouwer","given":"François"},{"family":"Vanneste","given":"Heleen"},{"family":"Mauquoy","given":"Dmitri"},{"family":"Piotrowska","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Torrejón","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Roland","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Stein","given":"Ariel"},{"family":"Roux","given":"Gaël Le"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,10,29]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,2]]},"container-title-short":"PLOS ONE"},

The depth profiles of stable Pb isotope ratios show, for the post-19th century period, the influence of several isotopically distinct anthropogenic lead sources, mainly including emissions from two Canadian smelters and from leaded gasoline combustion in Canada and in the United States. A most interesting feature of the profiles, however, is the presence of sharp stable Pb isotope ratio peaks near the depth horizon, where excess 210Pb becomes undetectable. Using a binary mixing model and assuming that natural Pb concentrations and isotopic compositions from the catchment are given by the pre-industrial sediments at the bottom of the cores, we find that a significant part of the anthropogenic Pb supplied to the sediments at this horizon originated from smelting activities in the Upper Mississippi Valley. We assess that the Pb isotope ratio peaks, also observed in the laminated sediments of the Pettaquamscutt Estuary, Rhode Island, USA, are an accurate chronostratigraphic marker for the validation of mid-19th century 210Pb-derived dates.

The accumulation rates of all studied elements followed the same trend, responding to changes in the total sedimentation rate. Concentration profiles differed among elements and showed considerable variation over time. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used on the concentration data to identify groups of elements that have similar geochemical controls. The first principal component was influenced by changes in mineral matter accumulation, and it incorporated elements that are associated with stable allochthonous minerals (such as Mg, K, Cs, Rb, Li, Ti and Ga), as well as elements in forms that become diluted when mineral matter increases (e.g., S, Fe and Mn). The second and third principal components showed that a large proportion of the variance was accounted for by elements with continuously increasing or decreasing concentrations related to pedogenetical development of the catchment soil. In the case of Hg, Pb and Cd, however, accumulation rates increased faster at the surface than is simply accounted for by changes in total sedimentation rates. For Cu, Cr, Ni and Zn, concentrations increased over the past 150 years, but there were no indications of a significant addition due to atmospheric deposition. These elements had more variable concentrations before the mid nineteenth century than after, as did elements that are often used for normalization.

The concentrations of trace metals, including Cu, Pb, Ni, and Zn, and major elements, Ca, Fe, and Mg, in a 14C- dated segment of sediment core were analyzed. Historical trends on the input of metals to Liangzhi Lake from around 5000 BC to the present were recorded in the sediments, representing about 7,000 years of history on the mining and utilization of metals in central China. The concentrations of Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn increased gradually from about 3000 ± 328 BC, indicating the start of the Bronze Age in ancient China. During the period 467 ± 257 to 215 ± 221 AD, there was a rapid increase in the concentrations of these metals in the sediments, indicating enormous inputs of these metals at that time. This era corresponded to China’s Warring States Period (475− 221 BC) and the early Han Dynasty (206 BC−220 AD), during which copper and lead were extensively used in making bronze articles such as vessels, tools, and weapons. From 1880 ± 35 AD to the early 1900s, there was also a significant increase in the concentrations of metals such as Cu, Ni, and Pb, which probably reflected the metal emissions and utilization during the early period of industrial development and weapon manufacture during the wars in China. The Pb isotopic analysis showed that the surface and subsurface sediments had lower 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb ratios than the deeper layers, reflecting the additional input of Pb from mining activities that took place during the Bronze Age era and in modern times.

These data clarify the chronological issues related to links between the onset of Yunnan metallurgy and the advent of bronze technology in adjacent Southeast Asia, subjects that have been debated for nearly half a century. We also observe an increase from 1100 to 1300 AD in a number of heavy metals including lead, silver, zinc, and cadmium from atmospheric emissions associated with silver smelting. Culminating during the rule of the Mongols, known as the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368 AD), these metal concentrations approach levels three to four times higher than those from industrialized mining activity occurring within the catchment today. Notably, the concentrations of lead approach levels at which harmful effects may be observed in aquatic organisms. The persistence of this lead pollution over time created an environmental legacy that likely contributes to known issues in modern day sediment quality.

The earliest evidence for Pb enrichment from                 smelting is on the Altiplano beginning ~AD 400, coincident with the rise of                 the pre-Incan Tiwanaku and Wari Empires. Coeval with the collapse of these Empires                 ~AD 1000, there is a dramatic decrease in Pb pollution on the Altiplano,                 suggesting metallurgical activity was closely tied to the Tiwanaku state. In                 contrast, metallurgy at Morococha, Peru and Potosí, Bolivia began ~AD                 1000—1200, likely as the result of the diaspora generated by the                 collapses of Tiwanaku and Wari.

Here, we apply a novel approach to characterize pre-industrial reference metal concentrations in river sediment downstream of Alberta oil sands development by analyzing metal concentrations in sediments deposited in floodplain lakes of the Athabasca Delta during 1700–1916, when they were strongly influenced by Athabasca River floodwaters. We compared results to metal concentrations in surficial bottom sediments sampled by RAMP (2010–2013) at downstream sites of the Athabasca River and distributaries. When normalized to lithium content, concentrations of vanadium (a metal of concern in the oil sands region) and other priority pollutants (Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, Zn) in nearly all of the RAMP river sediment samples lie below the upper 95% prediction interval linearly extrapolated from the river-derived lake sediments. Assuming the RAMP protocols obtained recently deposited sediment, this indicates that the metal concentrations in downstream Athabasca River sediment have not increased above pre-disturbance levels. Reference conditions derived from the lake sediment data were used to develop profiles of metal residual concentrations versus time for the RAMP river sediment data, which provides an excellent tool for decision-makers to identify and quantify levels of metal pollution for any given sample, and to monitor for future trends. We recommend that the approach be applied to resurrect the utility of RAMP data at other river sampling locations closer to the development, and for ongoing risk assessment. The approach is also readily transferable to other rivers where insufficient pre-disturbance reference data impairs an ability to determine if industrial activities are polluting downstream ecosystems.","URL":"http://stacks.iop.org/1748-9326/9/i=12/a=124019","DOI":"10.1088/1748-9326/9/12/124019","ISSN":"1748-9326","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Wiklund","given":"Johan A."},{"family":"Hall","given":"Roland I."},{"family":"Wolfe","given":"Brent B."},{"family":"Edwards","given":"Thomas WD"},{"family":"Farwell","given":"Andrea J."},{"family":"Dixon","given":"D.

However, rapid rates of sedimentation, proximity to urban centres and often the existence of management records, may make them potentially important resources for reconstructing recent, anthropogenically-derived environmental change. This project assesses the potential of reservoir sedimentary records for reconstructing past atmospheric and drainage basin fluxes of heavy metals (manganese, iron, nickel, copper, zinc and lead) in the southern Pennines, UK. Five reservoirs were selected on the basis of management history and drainage basin characteristics. Multi-parameter analysis showed sediments to be replicable across the ȁ8accumulating zone’ with reasonably consistent rates of sedimentation. Water level fluctuations were not found to detrimentally affect sediment records in the deepwater area of the reservoirs. In fact, spheroidal carbonaceous particle (SCP) profiles show trends in inputs that closely reflect major changes in industrialisation, indicating the reservoir sediments to be excellent records of particulate inputs. Only lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) were significantly enriched in the reservoir sediment in comparison to background levels. Manganese (Mn), iron (Fe) and to a limited degree, copper (Cu), appeared to be affected by post-deposition mobility. Preliminary calculations of Pb fluxes indicate that over 80% of the current Pb input to the reservoirs is from Pb deposited onto drainage basin soils in the past, rather than from direct atmospheric deposition or natural background inputs. In Howden reservoir, for example, the total Pb flux to deepwater sediment cores in 2000 was 119 mg m−2 a−1. Of this, an estimated 99 mg m−2 a−1 was from anthropogenically-derived Pb, initially deposited onto drainage basin soils and subsequently entering the reservoir via erosion and leaching processes. There is, therefore, no indication that the flux of Pb to the aquatic system is declining in response to reductions in Pb deposition. The ecotoxicological effects of the high and continuing Pb flux to these reservoirs, despite recent decreases in atmospheric deposition, is an area requiring further investigation.","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10933-005-1594-2","DOI":"10.1007/s10933-005-1594-2","ISSN":"1573-0417","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Shotbolt","given":"L."},{"family":"Hutchinson","given":"S.

Arsenic is largely associated with ferric iron in the form of oxyhydroxides in oxic waters and sediments as arsenate As (V). In deeper anaerobic sediments arsenic is released from iron oxyhydroxides because of the reduction of iron from the ferric to the more soluble ferrous state. Reducing environments can also be encountered in sediments relatively close to the sediment-water interface when there are high rates of biological activity that consume oxygen and create a reducing environment. For the past several years we have examined the relationships between organic carbon content of surface sediments, bottom water anoxia, redox zonation of sediments and the release of arsenic from freshwater sediments to the overlying waters. These studios have been performed using limnocorrals to isolate columns of water and their underlying sediments in Balmer Lake, a shallow freshwater system in Central Canada that has served as the final repository for tailings from two gold mines for more than 40 years. Our results indicate that surface sediments with higher organic carbon content are more susceptible to developing late season bottom water anoxia that can facilitate the subsequent release of arsenic from sediments to the overlying water. These results have implications for metal mining operations where reduced metal loadings from effluents or mine closure are expected to result in higher biological productivity and greater organic matter deposition to sediments.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/jp4:20030468","DOI":"10.1051/jp4:20030468","ISSN":"1155-4339","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Palace","given":"V.

This is the first laminated sediment sequence recorded in the region. However, visual counting of the layers was restricted due to partial indistinctness of the lamination. In order to confirm the annual sedimentary cyclicity and proceed with annually resolved data, in addition to the visual identification we used high resolution geochemical markers. The upper 160 mm of the sediment core were scanned at 200 µm intervals using synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence analysis (SR-XRF). Additional ultrahigh resolution scanning at 30 µm increments was employed for the upper 20 mm of the core. The Rb/Sr and Zr/Rb ratios are interpreted to record annual changes in grain-size. Based on this geochemical assessment, we identified 88 annual layers covering the interval between 1922 and 2010, while visually we have been able to identify between 70 and 100 layers. The correctness of the geochemical results is confirmed by mean accumulation rates assessed by 137Cs and 210Pb dating. Cross-correlation between the ring width of local pine chronology and the layer thickness, identified as a distance between the annual Rb/Sr peaks, allowed for the accurate dating of the uppermost preserved year of the sediment sequence (AD 2010). Annually averaged elemental data were then compared with regional meteorological observations, glacier mass balance and tree-ring chronologies. The comparison revealed notable conformities: content of bromine is positively correlated with annual temperatures (r=0.41, p<0.01), content of terrigenous elements (major elements with the origin in watershed rocks) is positively correlated (up to r=0.44, p<0.01) with annual precipitation. A high statistically significant negative relationship is observed between the concentrations of terrigenous elements and tree-ring width of local pine chronology (up to r=-0.56, p<0.01). Taken together, these data point to a common composite climatic signal in the two independent records (lake sediments and tree rings) and confirm that the laminae represent annual layers (i.e., varves). These findings open opportunities for high resolution multiproxy climate reconstructions 300-350 years long using the longer sediment core and tree-ring records.","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2018.00158/full","DOI":"10.3389/feart.2018.00158","ISSN":"2296-6463","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Alexandrin","given":"Mikhail Y."},{"family":"Darin","given":"Andrey V."},{"family":"Kalugin","given":"Ivan A."},{"family":"Dolgova","given":"Ekaterina A."},{"family":"Grachev","given":"Alexi M."},{"family":"Solomina","given":"Olga N."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,21]]},"container-title-short":"Front.

Cores from two N and three NE lakes were analyzed for cladocerans. 137Cs dating is unreliable in these lakes, probably due to mobility of Cs in the sediment. In Holmvatn sediment, an up-core increase in Fe, starting ca. 1900, correlates with geochemical indications of decreasing mechanical erosion of soils. Diatoms indicate a lake acidification starting in the 1920's. We propose that soil Fe was mobilized and runoff acidified by acidic precipitation and/or by soil acidification resulting from vegetational succession following reduced grazing. Even minor land use changes or disturbances in lake watersheds introduce ambiguity to the sedimentary evidence relating to atmospheric influences. Diatom counts from surface sediments in 36 N and 31 NE lakes were regressed against contemporary water pH to obtain coefficients for computing past pH from subsurface counts. Computed decreases of 0.3–0.8 pH units start between I890 and I930 in N lakes already acidic (pH 5.0–5.5) before the decrease. These and lesser decreases in other lakes start decades to over a century after the first sedimentary indications of atmospheric heavy metal pollution. It is proposed that the acidification of precipitation accompanied the metal pollution. The delays in lake acidification may be due to buffering by the lakes and watersheds. The magnitude of acidification and heavy metal loading of the lakes parallels air pollution gradients. Shift in cladoceran remains are contemporary with acidification, preceding elimination of fishes.","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00028438","DOI":"10.1007/BF00028438","ISSN":"1573-5117","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Davis","given":"Ronald B."},{"family":"Norton","given":"Stephen A."},{"family":"Hess","given":"C.

Surficial sediment concentrations (0–2 cm) ranged from 120 to 700 ng/g dry matter.Whole-lake burdens of Hg, used to determine the source of the contamination, were similar for all lakes in the study. The average anthropogenic component of the burden for all lakes was 0.79 mg/m2. This amount represents approximately one-half of the total burden in the sediments. There was a relationship between the size of a lake's catchment and the whole-lake burden of Hg in lakes in one region of the study area but not the remaining lakes.

For well-drained organic soils, as precipitation pH decreases, metals are differentially leached at an accelerated rate (Mn>Ca>Mg≥Zn>Cd and Na>Al). Experimental field and laboratory lysimeter studies on soil columns yield similar results, with increases in leaching rates for soil solutions with pH=3 up to 100 × values for soil solutions with pH=5. Nearly 100% of the Pb from precipitation is accumulating in the organic soil layer or sediments. Zn is accumulating in soils and sediments where the pH's of precipitation, soil solutions, and surface waters are generally above 5 to 5.5. At lower pH values Zn and other chemically similar elements are desorbed/leached (net) at an accelerated rate.Chemical analyses of dated sediment cores from high and low altitude lakes, with drainage basins relatively undisturbed for the last 200+ yr, reveal that increased deposition of metals on a regional scale started in the northeastern United States as early as 1880, consistent with increased fossil fuel consumption. This suggests acidified precipitation as early as 1880. Cores from historically acidified lakes (pH<≈5.3 to 5.5) indicate that, as acidification of surface waters occurs (caused by acidic deposition), concentrations of Zn, Mn, and Ca decrease in the sediment. Apparently the metals are leached from the detritus prior to sedimentation. This conclusion results from data from experimental acidification of sediment cores and the general observation that precipitation pH is generally ≥0.5 pH units lower than lake water pH. Accelerated leaching of soil in New England dates to earlier than 1900.","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02419415","DOI":"10.1007/BF02419415","ISSN":"1573-2932","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Hanson","given":"Denis W."},{"family":"Norton","given":"Stephen A."},{"family":"Williams","given":"John S."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1982,7,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,21]]},"container-title-short":"Water Air Soil Pollut"},

The timing of the inferred acidification is synchronous with known increases in emissions of sulfates and nitrates that are associated with acidic precipitation. Also, the increasing accumulation of substances related to emissions from the burning of fossil fuels (e.g., Pb, PAH) co-occurs with the lowering of DI pH in the sedimentary record. However, other processes may have accounted for or contributed to recent lake acidification. For instance, the drawdown of local water tables by human consumption may decrease the inseepage of ANC to seepage lakes. Such an effect would be synchronous with increasing depositions of sulfate. There is also clear evidence that Florida lakes are naturally acidic.

Surface sediment chrysophytes study suggests that the distribution of many chrysophyte taxa is closely related with lake water pH. Although these algal microfossils can be used as indicators of past lake water pH, their low abundance in the surface sediment samples of acidic lakes with high concentrations of certain metals indicates that they may be sensitive to high metal concentrations. The sensitivity of chrysophytes to metals was further examined by a stratigraphic study of chrysophytes in the sediments of Clearwater, Lohi, and Hannah lakes. The history of lake acidification in the study area is inferred from the stratigraphic analysis of diatoms and chrysophytes. As a result of increase in SO/sub 2/ emissions in the Sudbury basin, acidification occurred in Hannah and Clearwater lakes after 1880 and 1930 respectively.","URL":"https://qcat.library.queensu.ca/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=737929","author":[{"family":"Dixit","given":"S.S."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1986]]},"publisher-place":"Kingston, Ontario"},
